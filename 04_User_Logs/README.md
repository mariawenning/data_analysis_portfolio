In this mini-project I analysed the customer data using Pandas and Seaborn

**1. Goals of the project:**

 - Finding the most popular platform and the most active users.
 - Visualizing data with Seaborn distplot, barplot and countplot methods.

**2. Data description:**

user_data:

client - user ID
premium - whether the client is a premium
age - age

logs:

client - user ID
success - result (success - 1, no - 0)
platform - platform
time - time in Unix format
